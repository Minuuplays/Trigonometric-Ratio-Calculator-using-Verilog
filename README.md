This project is a Trigonometric Calculator designed in Verilog and implemented using Xilinx Vivado for the Basys3 FPGA board.
It takes an angle as input in binary and then converts it to decimal and calculates the sine, cosine, and tangent values using digital logic modules.

The results are displayed on a seven-segment display, and the user can select which trigonometric function to view through input buttons on the FPGA-board.
This project demonstrates modular Verilog design, constraint file usage, and FPGA-based computation.
